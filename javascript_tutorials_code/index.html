<!-- This is an example of an external js use case called by src keyword arg

    It helps in the reusability of code in more than one HTML file.
    It allows easy code readability.
    It is time-efficient as web browsers cache the external js files, which further reduces the page loading time.
    It enables both web designers and coders to work with html and js files parallelly and separately, i.e., without facing any code conflictions.
    The length of the code reduces as only we need to specify the location of the js file.
    There ate some security issues as well as potential multi js scipt dependency issues.
    If the js code is short, best to use internal JS intead.
